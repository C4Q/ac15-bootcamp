Access Code 2015 bootcamp
=

Welcome to the Access Code 2015 bootcamp!  In this workshop we'll be teaching
you the basics of HTML and CSS, the two languages you need to create web pages.
During this class, you'll learn the basics of each language, and how they work
together to build structured and beautiful web sites.

This workshop also serves as part of the Access Code application process. 
After this workshop, you'll be assigned a short project to create a web page
about yourself.  The assignment will test your understanding of what you will
learn today, as well as your ability and initiative to teach yourself with
information on line.  We'll look at the assignment as part of your application.

Environment
=

For this workshop, we'll use a simplified web development environment,
[jsbin](jsbin.com).  This site allows web developers to create and experiment
with simple web pages in an easy online environment.  You'll edit HTML and CSS
code directly on the site, and your web page will be rendered (displayed) live
in the same window.  It's the easiest way to get started.

Files
=

The examples and other files we'll use in this workshop are stored in this
github repo.  github is the most widely-used online system for storing
and sharing code.  A repository (or "repo") is a project in github, where a
number of related files are stored together.  We've created this repo to share
with you the files you'll need.

You can also access the sample web pages directly in jsbin.  To edit, click the
jsbin button in the upper right.  It will automatically make you your own
copy of the page, so you can feel free to change it any way you like.

- [index.html](http://jsbin.com/revupi), the skeleton page for your own work

- [ada-resume.html](http://jsbin.com/fovike), Ada's resume

- [ada.html](http://jsbin.com/cibuwe), Ada's personal page

You can create your own github account to store and publish your own code.
We strongly encourage you to do this, if you haven't yet!

Resources

The slides and materials in this workshop are just to get you started-- consider
them a jumping-off point for all the great information out there on the Web
about HTML, CSS, and any other technology topic.  

Search engines are your friend!  Google "Intro HTML" or "Intro CSS" for a range
of great tutorials and on-line classes.  When you get stuck, type a brief
description of your problem into the search bar and find other people's 
solutions.  With a bit of practice, you will be able to find a solution to
your HTML and CSS problems nearly 100% of the time.

Here are some particulrly useful links.

- [w3schools.com HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) is a great
  reference for nearly any HTML topic.  Use the tutorials on the left side of
  the page for introductory material.

- [w3schools.com CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is similarly
  great for CSS.

- The [HTML5 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/html/) is the technical
  definition of HTML verison 5, the current version used in most modern web
  sites.  It's not easy reading, but every detail of the language is fully
  specified here.

- The [CSS 2.1 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/) is the technical
  definition for the latest version of CSS.

- [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is the biggest programming question
  and answer site.  Nearly any HTML or CSS question you can imagine has been
  asked here, and has a number of useful anwers.  Just browsing is a great way
  to learn.

View Source

Another great way to learn about web sites is to study them.  You can examine
the HTML code of _each and every_ web site that you can visit in your web
browser.  Here's how to do this:

- In Chrome, press `Control-U` (Windows or Linux) or `Command-Option-U` (Mac).

- In Firefox, press `Control-U` (Windows or Linux) or `Command-U` (Mac).

- In Safari, first open the `Preferences > Advanced` tab and check `Show Develop
  menu in menu bar`.  Then, press `Command-Option-U` to view a page's HTML source.

- In Internet Explorer, first download and install Chrome or Firefox.  Then
  follow the instructions above.  :)

Viewing the CSS code is almost as simple.  Most sites store CSS in a separate
file.  Look through the HTML code for the site for a link to a .css file (there
may be more than one); use the search feature to help you do this.  Click on the
link to load the CSS file.

Note that many modern sites use very dense "minified" HTML and CSS code, which
may be hard to read.  Try looking at simple sites to learn your way around.
