Build your own personal page!

- Build your own personal page / resume for the web!
- See [this example project](ada) and [this page](http://cs.nyu.edu/web/People/phdstudents.html) for examples, but put your own spin on it.
- Consider using `ul`, `ol`, and `table` tags for additional structure.
- Use header (`h1`, `h2`...), `p`, and `span` tags for textual hierarchy.
- Use fonts, colors, borders, positioning or whatever else to make it fun.
- Include images!  Considering adding a headshot so we know who you are.
