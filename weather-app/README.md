# Team Project: build a weather app!

Use [index.html](index.html) as a starting point to build a simple weather application. Work with your teammates to design the app and then each person must execute a different section: morning, day, evening, night. We have provided [an example](example). This is for inspiration and a starting point, but you need--and should not--simply copy it.
